# ABCo Multicamera Platform

**This project is in early alpha and currently supports very little listed below.**

The multicamera platform is a free, open-source software environment that sits atop video switchers in live productions to offer a massive range of automation or crew support tools. Camera tally, cut logging, remote control, preview emulation, cross-switcher automation, all synchronizable across a network of devices under any configuration you please! And best of all? You don't have to install a thing - battle-test the app right now for your needs **straight** from the website! *Link coming soon*

Key features:

- **Tally** - The app can be synchronized across many devices on a local network, and offers a "tally viewers" for displaying a full-screen color. Literally just have your camera ops pull out their phones, visit the website, and link up to your network.
- **Remote control** - Control the switcher from any device anywhere! As long as it's linked into the platform's network, everything can be done from there all be there.
- **Cut Logging** - Record your cuts and export them into a video editor for easy post-production tweaking of your line cut. Native support for Premiere/DaVinci Resolve and the option to export to a standard format like CSV, for your own processing, is always available!
- **Automation* - 
- **Supports non-switchers** - Want to do multi-camera switching something in OBS? Because the platform provides one seamless abstraction layer on-top of your real switching hardware, you can do just that!
- **Emulates preview/cut buses** - If your switcher doesn't natively support a preview bus, or you want to interact with a switcher through the "cut bus"/alternative methods, the program provides an emulation layer for all of it, so you always have one consistent interfacing layer on top of your switcher.
